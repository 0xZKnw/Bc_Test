## 🗂️ Project Structure

Here’s an overview of the main files in the project:

- **`block.py`**: Contains the `Block` class that defines the structure of each block in the chain.
- **`chain.py`**: Implements the `Blockchain` class, managing the chain of blocks.
- **`node.py`**: Handles the network node logic, simulating communication between different blockchain nodes.
- **`main.py`**: The entry point for running the blockchain and initiating the operations.
